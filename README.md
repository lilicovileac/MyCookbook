MyCookbook –  allows you to add new recipes to a collection using a form. You can take pictures and save them to the collection from within the application.  îți The application stores its data localy using JSON, no internet connection is required when using the application. There is a built in timer that as we all know can come in handy when cooking.

My cookbook is compatible with Dark Mode
